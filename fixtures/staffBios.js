    bio: "Hi, and a warm welcome to Farrell Fitness. Personally I love meeting people and connecting with them on a personal level. I try to gain as much experience and knowledge from everyone I meet. Learning about my clients gives me a deep appreciation to the level of detail that they require to reach their goals. Whether that is to improve their sporting performance, build muscle, lose weight, lose body fat or just improve general health. I will give each client 110% because that is how I would like to be treated no matter where I go. I pride myself on my honesty and work ethic. I feel that’s why I really connect with all my clients because I genuinely care about each one. Everybody has a story to tell and I am more than happy to listen to you!",
